Chezuba is an online volunteering platform. You can help NGOs across the globe by signing up as a volunteer and you can make an impact from the comfort of your home. All the volunteering work is unpaid. We are not providing job opportunities in NGOs and volunteering doesnâ€™t guarantee a job allocation in an NGO.
